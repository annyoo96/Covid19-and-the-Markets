								<p>Originally, S&P 500 didn't contain 500 companies.
								A little more than 61 years ago, on March 4, 1957, the S&P 500 we know today took shape. Back then, as it is today, the Index was comprised of 500 companies. But the S&P 500 hasn't always tracked 500 companies. When it was first introduced in 1923, it was simply known as the "Composite Index" and tracked the performance of a relatively small number of companies. This was expanded in 1926 to include 90 stocks, which was the number it stuck with until its expansion to 500 companies in March of 1957.</p>

								<p>This visualization lets you compare our current situation (COVID-19) to the five biggest market crashes in the last hundred years. Because those five go down more and for longer than our current market, that doesn't mean that today's market crash will do the same thing. It could go straight back up after today or it could get worse. No one really knows what is going to happen, and the market hates uncertainty which is why we're seeing so much volatility.<p>

								<p>INSIGHT : The S&P 500 dropped more than -51% by the 23rd day from the peak closing price. It is clear to see that this is by far the fastest and worst drop comparing to other well-known crisis over the past 100 years. It's currently going back up at the day 37 mark, but like other crisis that had happened earlier, we can also predict that the market will fluctuate over a year.</p>

								<p>Company list includes 6 different companies in different sectors that had been in the S&P 500 companies list for 20+ years years. Since all these companies take part of the the graph above, it is nice to see how individial companies are doing compared to S&P 500 as a whole. </p>

								<p> INSIGHT : The company Chevron has declined by about 50% between day 0 to day 23, driven by the Coronavirus pandemic and turmoil in the crude oil markets. Due to shelter-in-place in most places, a lot of people started working from home remotely, and this results in not needing gas for a car anymore. From comparing other companies with Chevron, Chevron's closing price dropped the most during coronavirus.</p>

								<p> INSIGHT : The day 23 has been the worst for most of the companies marking S&P 500's day 23 the lowest as well. </p>

									<!--<p>These graphs let you compare our current situation (COVID-19) to the five biggest market crashes in the last hundred years.

I think the wise investing move is to continue investing early and often, buy and hold and stay the course</p> -->

								<p>When the first cases of a coronavirus caused by a novel coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, officials speculated that it was an unknown form of pneumonia. In mid-January, there were over 100 new cases of the illness in China, and the first case was identified in the United States.

								To combat the spread of the virus, countries have taken extraordinary measures, including closing the borders and implementing lockdowns of entire populations. This has, in effect, led to life grinding to a halt throughout the world.

								U.S. investors have remained largely unconcerned at the beginning of the outbreak, with the Dow reaching an all-time high of nearly 30,000 in mid-February. However, as the disease spread across Europe and began to affect the U.S., the outbreak’s devastating economic impact became increasingly clear.

								As many businesses remain closed and Americans are urged to stay in their homes to contain the spread of the virus, the full breadth and depth of the economic toll of the pandemic remains to be seen.

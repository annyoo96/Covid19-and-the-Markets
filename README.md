# Covid-19 and its Impact on the Stock Market

Our projectâ€™s focus is exploring the stock market, specifically Shubham focuses on exploring revenue and earnings trends prior to the sudden rise of Covid-19. Ann focuses on exploring via a historical analysis how the Covid-19 impact compares to previous market crashes. Rudy explores the Covid-19 dip in depth, painting a story of timelines and disproportionate impacts by companies and states.
